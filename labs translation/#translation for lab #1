#Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Cloud Marketplace

#Overview :
In this lab, I use Cloud Marketplace
to quickly and easily deploy a LAMP stack
on a Compute Engine instance. The Bitnami LAMP 
Stack provides a complete web development environment for 
Linux that can be launched in one click.

#Objectives:
Learning how to use cloud Marketplace and launch a solution

Task 1: Sign in to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console: 

for every lab there is a set given credentials, fixed time, 
and project name to start using GCP resourced, so we are going to
click on "start lab", opening new tab and sign in with our given username
and password.

Task 2: Use Cloud Marketplace to deploy a LAMP stack:

1. take a look in resources existing in cloud Console.
2. choose Marketplace from navigation menu
3. search for 'LAMP'
4. choose ' LAMP Certified by Bitnami '
5. launch its page => set your nearby zone - leave the rest of settings as default
6. deploy

Task 3: Verify your deployment.
1.When the deployment is complete, click the Site address link.
2. open ssh of the deployment 
3. type:  cd /opt/bitnami (current working directory command)
4.(To copy the phpinfo.php script from the installation directory to a publicly accessible 
location under the web server document root) => sudo sh -c 'echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > apache2/htdocs/phpinfo.php'

6. exit ssh.
7. open a new tab and type : http://SITE_ADDRESS/phpinfo.php
