#Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Compute Engine

## Overview:
In this lab, you will create virtual machines (VMs) and connect to them. 
You will also create connections between the instances.

## Objectives
- learn how to perform the following tasks:

- Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.

- Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.

- Connect between the two instances.

## steps

Task 1: Sign in to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console:
sign in with your given credentials to enters GCP Console.


Task 2: Create a virtual machine using the GCP Console:

1. heading to navigatione menu, choose compute Engine, VM instances.
2. Click Create.
3. type a unique name for your VM.
4. For Region and Zone, select the region and zone assigned by Qwiklabs.
5. For Boot disk, if the Image shown is not Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch), click Change and select Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch).
6.Leave the defaults for Identity and API access unmodified.
7. For Firewall, click Allow HTTP traffic.
8. Leave all other defaults unmodified.
9. click Create.

Task 3: Create a virtual machine using the gcloud command line:

1. heading to Cloud shell.
2. press on conitnue button
3. to see the given zones list in the region to which Qwiklabs assigned you,
type 'gcloud compute zones list | grep us-central1' command.
4. Choose a zone from the list (the one which Qwiklabs assigned you)
5. to set your default zone => 'gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b'
6. to create VM2 => gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" \
--machine-type "n1-standard-1" \
--image-project "debian-cloud" \
--image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" \
--subnet "default"
7.exit.

Task 4: Connect between VM instances:

1. heading to navigatione menu, choose compute Engine, VM instances.
2.click on ssh of "my-vm-2"
3.to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network 
we use => ping my-vm-1 (Press Ctrl+C to abort the ping command.)
4. Use the ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1 => ssh my-vm-1
5.install the Nginx web server on my-vm-1 => sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y
6. we Use the nano text editor to add a custom message or make a change in the appearance of the home page of the web server =>
sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
7. Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the line just below the h1 header. 
Add text like this, and replace YOUR_NAME with your name => Hi from YOUR_NAME
8. Press Ctrl+O and then press Enter to save your edited file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit the nano text editor.
9. Confirm that the web server is serving your new page. At the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command => curl http://localhost/
10. To exit the command prompt on my-vm-1 => exit
11. To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2 => curl http://my-vm-1/
